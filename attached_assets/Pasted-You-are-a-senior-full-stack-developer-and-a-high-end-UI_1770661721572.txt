You are a senior full-stack developer and a high-end UI/UX designer.
Your mission is to build the official DARYL website for the domain daryl.md,
inspired by the clarity, elegance, and minimalism of apple.com.

OBJECTIVE
Create a premium, minimal, Apple-like website that presents DARYL as an
intelligence layer bridging narrative, AI systems, and autonomous agents.
The site must feel calm, confident, futuristic, and timeless.
